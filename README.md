# Imoria 4.8

This repository contains the VMS Pascal source code for the Imoria roguelike
game, as developed at the University of Washington in 1989.

This is a variant of the original Moria game written by Robert Alan Koeneke.

Very little about this version, but according to the people at University
Washington, it is far superior to any other Moria version that existed at the
time.  It has many new monsters, new objects, new races, new classes, new
terrain types (like water), etc.

Program IMORIA was developed by Kenneth Case, Mary Conner, Robert DeLoura,
Dan Flye, Todd Gardiner, Dave Jungck, Andy Walker, Dean Yasuda.

Many sources say there is a v4.9 of Imoria available, if you have access to
this source code, please get in touch!
